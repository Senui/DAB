**Answers**
* The main functionalities of the Data Access Broker (DAB) API should be to receive a request for a set of datasets (one or more) by their persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, but could be also other formats in the future). Additionally there could be a subselection step involved to further narrow down which exact subset of each dataset could be needed. This subset could be a list of files, a query on a table or database, or something else. The API should resolve each persistent identifier to retrieve metadata about the access scope of the dataset in question. The data scope could be a license or a metadata tag that specifies if the data is open access or restricted. Data that is open access should be directly downloadable by the end user. The data however can reside on one or more data provider's data repositories. The DAB should be able to resolve from the persistent identifier a way to fetch the download link from the underlying data provider. If the data is restricted, an access request should be made to the corresponding data provider. This access request should be a formal procedure, which requires the user to login with a federated institution identity and require one or more fields to give more information about the request (e.g. why does this research need this dataset?). The request should result in either a call to the data provider's data request API or as a fallback option offer a way to use the DAB as a way to handle the request directly (e.g. offer a web-interface thorugh which the data provider can handle the request). The data provider handles the request (approve, deny or require more info) and sends back an answer to the API. The requester receives a notification of this answer and is able to keep track of the data requests and the status thereof. Based on the data access scope the data can be made available to the researcher (a download specific to that user) or can be made available for analysis in a secure analysis environment at a specific service provider that offers that kind of service. Either way authentication of the user must be made in order to get access to this data.

* There are two roles that will interact with the API: the researcher role and data provider role. The researcher role makes the request for accessing the data and awaits the approval by the data provider. Once approval is made the researchers can either download the data or be referred to a secure analysis environment to perform the analysis on the data there. The data provider either approves, rejects or requires more information of the researcher for a request. The data provder feeds the API the necessary details to fetch the data from their data repository. The data provide could be a real person that interacts directly with the API or could be a service account that acts on behalf of the data provider to automate this interaction. This however should not be part of this API.

* Specific entities in my API would be: data request, persistent identifier (of data), subselection of data, data license, data provider's data repository, metadata repository

## Core Entities and Modules
**PersistentIdentifier**: Represents the unique identifiers for datasets. This class could be designed to support multiple formats (e.g., DOI, URN) and could be easily extended to accommodate new identifier formats in the future.
**DataRequest**: Encapsulates all details of a request made by a researcher, including the persistent identifier(s) of the dataset(s), any subselection criteria, and metadata like the request status, researcher information, and the intended use of the data.
**Subselection**: Defines the criteria for subselecting data within a dataset. This could be implemented as an interface or abstract class, with concrete subclasses for different types of subselections (e.g., FileListSubselection, QuerySubselection).
**DataLicense**: Represents the access scope of a dataset, such as open access or restricted. This could include methods to determine the availability of data based on its license.
**DataProviderRepository**: Contains information necessary to fetch data from a data provider's repository, including API endpoints, authentication details, and methods to initiate data transfers or access requests.
**MetadataRepository**: Manages the retrieval of dataset metadata, including data licenses and subselection capabilities. This could interface with various metadata storage solutions or services.
**UserAuthentication**: Manages the authentication of users, supporting different roles and potentially different authentication mechanisms, including federated institution identity systems.
**DataAccessRequestHandler**: Handles the logic for processing data access requests, including checking data licenses, submitting requests to data providers for restricted data, and notifying researchers of the request status.
**NotificationService**: Handles sending notifications to researchers about the status of their data requests.
**SecureAnalysisEnvironment**: Represents the secure environment where researchers can analyze data. This could include methods for authenticating users and provisioning access to datasets within the environment.

## Modular Design Considerations
**Extensibility for New Data Formats**: The PersistentIdentifier class should be designed so new identifier formats can be easily added, perhaps through a plugin mechanism or by using a factory pattern that can instantiate the correct handler based on the identifier type.
**Flexible Data Subselection**: The Subselection entity's design as an interface or abstract class allows for the easy addition of new subselection mechanisms as the need arises.
**Decoupling of Data Access and Notification Logic**: By separating the DataAccessRequestHandler and NotificationService, the system can vary the notification mechanism (email, webhooks, etc.) independently of how data access requests are processed.
**Abstract Data Provider Interface:** The DataProviderRepository could implement an interface that allows for different implementations for interacting with various data provider systems, making it easier to add support for new data providers in the future.

## Class Diagram Sketch
Given the complexity and the need for precision in class diagrams, a detailed drawing is beyond the scope of this text response. However, a basic sketch would include:

Classes for each of the entities mentioned above, with associations indicating how they interact. For example, DataRequest would be associated with PersistentIdentifier, Subselection, and DataLicense.
Arrows indicating dependency or inheritance, such as Subselection being a superclass of FileListSubselection and QuerySubselection.
Interfaces like IDataProviderRepository, which could be implemented by classes representing specific data provider repositories.
This outline provides a foundation for a modular and extensible system. The actual implementation could involve more details and refinements, especially regarding data models and the interactions between different components of the API.
